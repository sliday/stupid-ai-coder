Title: Spirograph Visualization with Parameters in Python

Abstract:

This RFC proposes the development of a flexible, creative, and optimized Python-based spirograph visualization module.

Introduction:

Spirographs are intricate geometric designs based on the motion of a point within rotating circles. This RFC proposes a Python-based visualization tool to generate spirograph patterns. Users can define parameters such as radii, speed ratios, pen offset, and colors, thus allowing endless creativity. The goal is to optimize the implementation for flexibility, enabling users to tweak various parameters easily and generate unique designs without in-depth knowledge of the underlying mathematics.

Problem Statement:

The traditional spirograph is a physical device used to draw geometric figures. Although digital versions exist, most are static and limited in terms of creativity. This RFC addresses the need for a flexible, dynamic, and parameter-driven Python tool that allows users to generate customizable spirograph patterns programmatically.

Goals:

	1.	Provide a flexible Python module that generates spirograph visualizations.
	2.	Allow users to easily adjust parameters to create unique designs.
	3.	Optimize the code for creativity and flexibility.
	4.	Output the visualizations in a variety of formats (e.g., PNG, SVG).
	5.	Ensure the tool is user-friendly and accessible to both novice and expert users.

Non-Goals:

	1.	Creating a GUI for the spirograph tool (CLI-based tool for now).
	2.	Simulating physical spirograph movements with constraints.

Parameters:

The proposed spirograph module will allow users to modify the following parameters:

	1.	Inner radius (r_inner): The radius of the inner circle.
	2.	Outer radius (r_outer): The radius of the outer circle.
	3.	Pen offset (pen_offset): The distance from the center of the inner circle to the pen point.
	4.	Speed ratio (speed_ratio): The relative speed of rotation between the inner and outer circles.
	5.	Number of rotations (n_rotations): The number of rotations for which the pattern should be drawn.
	6.	Color (color): Color or gradient of the pattern.
	7.	Stroke width (stroke_width): Width of the lines in the spirograph.
	8.	Background (background): Optional background color.
	9.	Resolution (resolution): Defines the precision of the drawing.
	10.	Output format (output_format): The format to save the visualization (e.g., PNG, SVG, etc.).

Python Implementation Strategy:

Core Formula:

The spirograph curve is typically defined by the parametric equations:

x(t) = (R - r) * cos(t) + pen_offset * cos(((R - r) / r) * t)
y(t) = (R - r) * sin(t) - pen_offset * sin(((R - r) / r) * t)

Where:

	•	R: Outer radius
	•	r: Inner radius
	•	pen_offset: Distance from the center of the inner circle to the pen point
	•	t: Time (angle parameter)

Optimized Python Code:

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class Spirograph:
    def __init__(self, r_inner, r_outer, pen_offset, speed_ratio, n_rotations, 
                 color='black', stroke_width=1, resolution=1000, background='white'):
        self.r_inner = r_inner
        self.r_outer = r_outer
        self.pen_offset = pen_offset
        self.speed_ratio = speed_ratio
        self.n_rotations = n_rotations
        self.color = color
        self.stroke_width = stroke_width
        self.resolution = resolution
        self.background = background

    def generate_points(self):
        t = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi * self.n_rotations, self.resolution)
        R, r, o = self.r_outer, self.r_inner, self.pen_offset
        x = (R - r) * np.cos(t) + o * np.cos(((R - r) / r) * t * self.speed_ratio)
        y = (R - r) * np.sin(t) - o * np.sin(((R - r) / r) * t * self.speed_ratio)
        return x, y

    def draw(self, output_format='png', filename='spirograph_output'):
        x, y = self.generate_points()
        
        # Plot setup
        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        fig.patch.set_facecolor(self.background)
        ax.set_facecolor(self.background)
        
        ax.plot(x, y, color=self.color, linewidth=self.stroke_width)
        ax.axis('equal')
        ax.axis('off')  # Hide axes for clean look
        
        # Save the figure
        plt.savefig(f"{filename}.{output_format}", format=output_format, dpi=300)
        plt.show()

# Example usage:
spiro = Spirograph(r_inner=50, r_outer=100, pen_offset=70, speed_ratio=1, 
                   n_rotations=10, color='blue', stroke_width=2, resolution=5000)
spiro.draw(output_format='png', filename='creative_spiro')

Usage Examples:

Basic Example:

# Create a basic spirograph with default parameters
spiro = Spirograph(40, 100, 50, 1, 12)
spiro.draw()

Advanced Example with Custom Parameters:

# Customize the spirograph for a more intricate design
spiro = Spirograph(r_inner=80, r_outer=150, pen_offset=90, speed_ratio=0.8, 
                   n_rotations=30, color='red', stroke_width=2, resolution=3000, background='black')
spiro.draw(output_format='svg', filename='complex_spiro')

Performance Optimizations:

	•	Vectorized Computations: Leverage NumPy for efficient vectorized calculations of x and y coordinates.
	•	Adjustable Resolution: Provide the option for users to define the resolution (number of points in the spirograph), allowing for fine-grained control over performance and visual detail.
	•	Efficient Rendering: Use Matplotlib for visualizing and exporting the spirograph in different formats, leveraging efficient backend rendering.

Flexibility and Extensibility:

	1.	Customizable Parameters: Users can modify key parameters, including radii, speed ratio, and pen offset, to create unique spirograph designs.
	2.	Output Options: Provide options for different output formats (PNG, SVG, etc.) and the ability to control resolution and visual details.
	3.	Dynamic Design Adjustments: The tool allows dynamic adjustment of parameters during runtime, making it easy for users to experiment with different designs.

Security Considerations:

This module does not interact with external systems or user input directly, so security risks are minimal. However, users should validate file paths and ensure proper handling of any external dependencies.

Conclusion:

The proposed Python-based spirograph visualization module offers a highly flexible and creative tool for generating spirograph patterns. By allowing users to easily adjust parameters, the module encourages creative exploration while providing an optimized and efficient codebase.
